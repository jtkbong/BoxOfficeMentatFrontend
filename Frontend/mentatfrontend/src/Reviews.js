                    Will Smith makes the genie role his own, but the real star of the show is Jasmine played by Naomi Scott. The songs and singing are mostly as enjoyable as the original (which is either my favorite or second favorite animated Disney...idk lol), but the new solo Jasmine song "Speechless" is what at least sets this film apart from a cheap cash-grab remake. Do check it out because it's awesome and really showcases Scott's singing ability!

                    As for the bad of the movie...really did not like this version of Jafar. They do try to make him more complex and it works to some degree, but as the film's villain, he just never felt threatening to me. Guy Ritchie's vision of Agrabah also didn't feel right, it was either lacking in scale and grandeur, or not realistic and dirty enough? I guess you could say it was lacking in detail and ambition. Lastly, there were some really weird shots in this movie that are just...super awkward.

                    Aladdin fulfills 6 out of 10 wishes, assuming I get 3 Robin Williams genies and a 0.333333333333333 Will Smith genie.

                <h4>Dark Phoenix</h4><br />
                <p>
                    In the year 2000, the X-Men movie was released and changed Hollywood and entertainment forever...

                    Having followed the franchise since then (while also being a fan of Uncanny X-books), I had to make myself see Dark Phoenix despite the terrible reviews and problems it had during production.

                    I am surprisingly not entirely disappointed. There definitely are problems with letting a newbie director direct a big budget blockbuster as his first movie, certain cast members are STILL insufferable (JLaw's Mystique + Nicholas Hoult's emo beast), fan-favorites Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler are still underserved af, and Jessica Chastain almost doesn't add anything to the film, but overall the movie didn't feel like a cheap remake of XTLS and some of the mutant power action is still pretty good.

                    The movie is definitely much more intense than any of the previous entries sans Logan. I don't think there was even a single MCU-like joke. This, plus the somewhat small-scale final action sequence (sadly, this is 90% because of the Fox-Disney merger...) probably led the the disastrous rotten tomato score.

                    If you've followed the X-Men since the beginning, then finish watching their story, I don't think you would be overall disappointed. Otherwise, there are tons of other movies to see lol...
